# 1. Introduction

## 1.2 Environment preparation

I use GitHub Codespaces to run do this module.
Steps run so far:

### Step 1: Install miniforge
From my past working experience, I prefer to use mamba instead of conda for performance reason.
```sh
wget "https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh"
```
